Quuck How To:

This is a quick how to on using the included R script. As of right now, the script is used to make graphs for each bbox area
for the Beijing qeury. In the future, though, a more general script will be added.

1. Open the script in your prefered editor and change the file path of where the data is located and where the graphs will be
saved to.
2. Once complete, open a new terminal window and go to the directory where the script is saved, and then type this in the console:
 ```
 R
 ```
3. This will start R, and once you are given the prompt type the following:
 ```
 source('path/to/comparative_analysis_bbox_beijing.R')
 ```
4. After a minute or two, the script will finish running and checking the directory where the graphs were saved will show
8 different graphs.
